    "Thus far we have a solid basic conceptual understanding of neural networks and their basic architecture. We've seen neural networks for classification including a neural network with no hidden layers (logistic regression), one hidden layer, and several hidden layers. From here, we'll begin to use Keras, a package that has prebuilt many of the building blocks of neural networks which we investigated in previous lessons.  \n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a tensor \n",
    "- Perform tensor slicing \n",
    "- Explain the different tensor operations (element-wise, broadcast, and dot product) \n",
    "- Explain how an epoch and batch relate to one another \n",
    "- Explain the steps to build a neural network in Keras \n",

The larger the batch, the better the approximation; however, it is also true that the batch will take longer to process and will still result in only one update. For inference (evaluate/predict), it is recommended to pick a batch size that is as large as you can afford without going out of memory (since larger batches will usually result in faster evaluation/prediction).\n",
